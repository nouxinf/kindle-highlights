# How to use Kindle Clip

Firstly, you have to be on desktop or a device that you can connect your kindle to to use this website. This is because it needs your kindle to be connected by USB.

This site works by uploading your `My Clippings.txt` file. This file stores all the highlights you've made on your kindle.

Click the upload button. To find this file, plug in your Kindle to your computer, open it up in file explorer. You will probably see 4 folders:

- `audible`
- `documents`
- `fonts`
- `screenshots`

Go into the `documents` folder. Here you'll see all the books you have on your kindle. Find a text file named `My Clippings` or `My Clippings.txt`. Double click it, and it should load.
